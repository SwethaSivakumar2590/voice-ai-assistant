# 🧠 Real-Time Voice AI Assistant (Python + LLaMA 3)

A **real-time voice AI assistant** that listens to your spoken questions, reasons using a **local Large Language Model (LLaMA 3)**, and responds in natural voice — entirely offline and interactive.

---

## 🎯 Example Interaction

**User (voice):**  
> "What is Machine Learning?"

**Assistant (voice):**  
> "Machine Learning is a branch of artificial intelligence where systems learn from data and improve performance without explicit programming."

**✅ Key points:**  
- Fully **local**, no cloud API  
- Works **entirely through voice**

## ⚙️ System Workflow (Step by Step)

### 🎧 Voice Input
Captures user speech via microphone.

### 📝 Speech-to-Text
Converts audio into text using **SpeechRecognition**.

### 🧠 AI Reasoning (LLM)
Text is sent to **LLaMA 3 (Ollama)** running locally to generate an intelligent response.

### 🔊 Text-to-Speech
Converts AI text output into natural speech using **pyttsx3**.

### 🔁 Voice Output
Assistant speaks the response back in **real time**.

📌 Notes & Tips

Requires a working microphone

Ensure LLaMA 3 is pulled locally

.venv or virtual environment should not be pushed to GitHub

Adjust microphone sensitivity if the assistant doesn’t hear you
